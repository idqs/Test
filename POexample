Morning All,

Recently it is found that some PO was not generated before a performance of products/services is delivered, this is obviously an after-fact PO which is not allowed and this had been communicated in the Hub P2P process during the training sessions.

Once again, please note a PO shall be always generated and approved prior to the goods/services is delivered, the following policy is clearly documented in the P2P process:  No PO, No Work, No Payment  - unless written commitment received from ANZ Authorized Person; 
the only exception is: in some emergency situation, you might need a supplier to deliver some service/product immediately otherwise the hub might be at a risk to be closed down or be heavily impacted such as interruption of normal operating/huge loss/facility damage/reputational damage etc(for example, a critical equipment needs an urgent repair and the time is not sufficient for you to do the PO document as you need immediately to work with the supplier to solve this problem) , however this is for emergency situation only and you still need to generate the PO once the service is delivered. 

Please also refer to the Q&A session in the P2P process which I have documented around the use of a PO.
