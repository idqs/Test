About Compliance & Operational Risk

Compliance Principles have been developed and mandated by the Board.  They are simple and clear, stating that ANZ will:

1.Do the right thing the right way
2.Adopt an Enterprise-wide approach to compliance 
3.Clearly define authority and accountability 
4.Establish and maintain an independent compliance function 
5.Have no tolerance for deliberate non-compliance 
6.Implement an adequate risk and control environment and promptly respond to deficiencies.
Operational Risk is the risk of a loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.  This includes legal and regulatory risks and the risk of reputational loss or damage, but excludes strategic risk (for which Management Board is responsible). 

We provide the frameworks and tools that help our businesses consider the business environment and forward-looking strategy and focus on the key risks that could impact achieving our business objectives.  We help them to focus on the key controls that have the most impact on preventing, detecting or reducing the impact of a key risk .  Risk and controls are at the core of our Operational Risk Measurement and Management Framework (ORMMF).
